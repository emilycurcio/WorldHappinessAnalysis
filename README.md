### Project Description:
The Gallup World Poll conducts polls that aim to represent the opinions of entire countries. We want to use the World Happiness Report data to better understand what differentiates the countries with a higher happiness rating. Here are the main questions we would like to answer:
- What do the countries with the highest happiness scores have in common?
- What is the most differentiating factor when it comes to happiness scores?
- Which regions rank higher in happiness?

### Data:
Data set contains an overall happiness score for each country as well as contributing scores such as economy, family, health, etc.
